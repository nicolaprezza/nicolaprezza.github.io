# About

<img src="figures/nicola.png" align="right" width="50%" hspace="30" vspace="0" alt="be balanced" />

Hi! I'm an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Ca' Foscari University of Venice. My research interests include algorithms and data structures for the manipulation and analysis of compressed strings and graphs, both from the theoretical and practical viewpoints and with applications to bioinformatics. I received my Ph.D. in Computer science from the university of Udine in 2017, with a [thesis](pdfs/Compressed Computation for Text Indexing.pdf) on dynamic compressed data structures under the supervision of Prof. Alberto Policriti. After that, I have been postdoc researcher for one year at the technical university of Denmark, Copenhagen (DTU), for two more years at the university of Pisa, and then Assistant Professor at LUISS Guido Carli University, Rome.

I co-authored more than 60 research articles within my research field and I developed the first C++ [library](https://github.com/xxsds/DYNAMIC) of dynamic compressed data structures, in addition to more than 30 other repositories dealing with data compression and bioinformatics. I am/have been on the program committees of more than 10 international conferences including DCC 2020/2022/2024, ESA 2023, IWOCA 2021, ISAAC 2021, CPM 2018/2020, SPIRE 2020/2022/2025, WABI 2025, SOSA 2024, co-chaired the 13th Workshop on Compression, Text and Algorithms (WCTA 2018), and I have been invited speaker at ICTCS 2018, IABD 2019, CPM 2019, SEA 2020, SPIRE 2021, and CPM 2025. I am program chair and organizer of the 23th Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2025), to be held in Venice. I am the recipient of the 2018 [Best Italian Young Researcher in Theoretical Computer Science](https://www.eatcs.org/index.php/italian-chapter) award of the Italian Chapter of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, and I'm PI of [this](https://pric.unive.it/projects/regindex/home) ERC starting grant (about 1.4M €) on indexing and compressing labeled graphs and regular languages. I'm also a mentor at the [Orthogonal school](https://www.elicsir.it/scuola-ortogonale), under the [Elicsir](https://www.elicsir.it/) foundation.
